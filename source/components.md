# Components

Components are common assemblies of the tools in Foundation. Sometimes, these are all we need to achieve the styling required. You will frequently use Components to build your Structures.

We included five common Components by default:

## 1. Bucket

Media element next to a piece of content.

## 2. Card

Individual style containers.

## 3. Cell

Width-limiting blocks.

## 4. Grid

Full, responsive grid.

## 5. Row

Width-spanning blocks.
