# Structures

Structures (or Modules) in this context refer to any unit of style that can be found across multiple pages. **Most of your styles should be found here**. This draws from the OOCSS idea of separating everything into reusable chunks, making it second-nature if you're familiar with that method.

## Examples of Structures

Here are some commonly occurring examples of structures:

- Modals
- Buttons
- Tooltips
- Navigation
- Re-appearing chunks of content, like a user info card or sidebar
