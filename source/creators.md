# The Creators

[Drew Barontini](https://twitter.com/drewbarontini) and [Nick Walsh](https://twitter.com/nickawalsh) are front-end devs at Orlando-based [Envy Labs](http://envylabs.com/) and [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com/). Both are adamant about alphabetizing properties, keeping personal effects at right angles, and unfortunately don't sport (or attempt to) the above facial hair.

## Workshop

Interested in learning how to tackle modern applications, keep your styles maintainable, and employ a number of common patterns? We're running a day-long workshop at this year's [Front-End Design Conference in St. Petersburg](http://frontenddesignconference.com/), FL. Space is limited!
