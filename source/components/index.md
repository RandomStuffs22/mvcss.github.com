# Components

Components are common assemblies of the tools in Foundation. Sometimes, these are all we need to achieve the styling required.

We included five common Components by default:

## 1. [Bucket](/foundation/bucket)

Media element next to a piece of content.

## 2. [Card](/foundation/card/)

Individual style containers.

## 3. [Cell](/foundation/cell/)

Width-limiting blocks.

## 4. [Grid](/foundation/grid/)

Full, responsive grid.

## 5. [Row](/foundation/row/)

Width-spanning blocks.
