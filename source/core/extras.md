## Extras

### Inbox

Adding an inbox section to the bottom of your application file allows developers, and those not actively working on the CSS, to quickly add styles that are easily seen by the maintainer of the file.

### Compass

[Compass](http://compass-style.org/) provides utilities and niceties to make your life easier. We use it, and we recommend that you give it a try. There's even a placeholder comment at the top of the application file that shows you where to put your imports for Compass.
